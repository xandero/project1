  Q. Does this site have bugs?
</p></h4>
<p>
  A. It's interesting you should ask that. The world is full of bugs, and often we can encounter them in the most unexpected of places. Sometimes in the kitchen late at night. Sometimes early in the morning when we're in the bathroom. And then, on extremely rare occasions, perhaps, just perhaps, whilst we're browsing the interwebs navigating around certain sites.

  I'm just saying, it's possible.

  Q. Was building this site easy?
</p></h4>
<p>
  Funny. Yeah, it was a total breeze. I was actully drunk the entire time, which surprisingly didn't seem to slow me down at all (hello Ballmer Peak). Incredibly, no one actually noticed that my head was in the clouds the entire week. I should probably do that more often...
